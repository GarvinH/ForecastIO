# Forecast.IO
A weather web application made using ReactJS.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to setup this project

```
NodeJS
```

### Installing

First clone the repository using this link: https://github.com/GarvinH/ForecastIO.git

Install all node dependencies

```
npm i
```

The setup should be complete and you should now be able to run the app in development mode.

```
npm run react_start   
```

If the page doesn't open on its own, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


To run with a local server
```
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

If changes are made in src, be sure to run
```
npm run build
```
before attempting to run npm start. The server will not reflect changes on its own and npm run start must be run every build.
